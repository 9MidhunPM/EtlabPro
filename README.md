# EtlabPro

<img src="frontend/assets/images/splash-icon.png" alt="EtlabPro app icon" width="120" align="right" />

EtlabPro is a full-stack student companion platform for Sahrdaya ETLAB users. It combines a production-oriented FastAPI backend, ETLAB scraping workflows, Supabase persistence, and a Flutter mobile app with rich analytics across attendance, internal marks, semester results, monthly calendar view, and timetable.

## What EtlabPro Does

- Authenticates with ETLAB and syncs academic data into normalized storage.
- Serves a secure API for mobile consumption.
- Provides mobile dashboards for:
  - Home insights (attendance + result summaries)
  - Attendance tracking and risk analysis
  - CAT result breakdown with projection analysis
  - University end-sem result history by semester
  - Day-wise timetable and monthly attendance calendar

## Architecture Overview

Backend responsibilities:

- FastAPI API surface for auth, sync, live comparison, and analytics reads.
- Scrapers for profile, attendance, marks, timetable, and university results.
- Service layer orchestration that controls refresh policies and sync lifecycle.
- Supabase persistence through dedicated DB modules.

Frontend responsibilities:

- Secure login/session handling.
- JWT-backed API calls to protected endpoints.
- Local cached state for resilience and faster UX.
- Light and dark themed UI for all major student workflows.

## Current Deployment (Self-Hosted)

EtlabPro is currently self-hosted in Bangalore on a Dokploy setup.

Current hosting posture:

- Containerized backend deployment (FastAPI/Uvicorn) managed via Dokploy.
- Environment-driven secret management for runtime configuration.
- Public API exposure through a controlled self-hosted infrastructure boundary.
- Security-oriented backend defaults (JWT auth, CORS allow-list, reduced logging, docs disabled in production mode).

This gives you direct infrastructure control while keeping the application safely self-hosted and maintainable.

## Security and Safety

EtlabPro is designed with a safe-by-default backend model when operated with correct deployment practices.

Implemented in code:

- JWT access/refresh token flow for authenticated access.
- Protected routes enforced via Bearer token dependency checks.
- CORS origin restrictions from environment configuration.
- Supabase service role key only used server-side.
- Mobile credentials/tokens stored with encrypted secure storage.
- Production docs disabled by default.
- Concise operational logging to reduce sensitive signal leakage.

Operational best practices to keep it safe over time:

- Keep all secrets in environment variables and rotate them periodically.
- Enforce HTTPS end-to-end in front of Dokploy-managed services.
- Restrict DB and admin access by network and role.
- Monitor auth failures, sync anomalies, and dependency updates.
